# Pong Game

## A simple version of Pong built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS

This was a simple exercise to continue practicing JavaScript and for familiarisation with HTML5 features such as:

- The `<Canvas>` tag for drawing graphics with JavaScript using the `getContext()` method
- The `requestAnimationFrame()` method for updating animations in the browser
- The `document.createElement()` method for creating HTML element nodes
- The `document.querySelector()` method for selecting HTML elements
- The `addEventListener()` event target method for creating functions to be triggered by user interaction

### How to run:

Run `index.html` locally in your browser
